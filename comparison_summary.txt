Comparison Summary (Architecture & Checklist vs Implementation)

Legend: ✅ Implemented | ⚠️ Partially done | ❌ Missing

FRONTEND (rfid-frontend)

- Framework & tooling (Vite + TS + Tailwind v4): ✅
- Global layout (sidebar/header/footer as per architecture): ⚠️ (Navigation present; no full layout/sidebars)
- Auth UI (Login with City, Protected routes): ✅
- Tenant login (Project + City): ❌ (City-only; tenant design in ARCHITECTURE.md not yet implemented)
- Auth state (AuthContext, tokens, profile load): ✅
- City/Tenant context: ⚠️ (CityContext implemented; TenantContext not yet)
- Dashboard (location KPIs, sorting, links): ✅
- Real-time updates via WebSocket (KPI refresh, key events): ✅
- Users (list/search/sort/paginate, CSV export): ✅
- Users (create/edit/delete, role-gated): ✅
- Permissions UI (grant/revoke): ✅
- RFID keys UI (list/add/toggle active): ✅
- Access Logs page (filters, export): ✅
- Audit Logs page (filters): ✅
- Location Details page (/locations/:addressId): ⚠️ (Exists as /location/:addressId; UI wired for bulk ops; route naming deviation and not in Navigation)
- Post-login redirect to assigned location(s): ❌
- Tests (components/hooks/e2e): ⚠️ (Vitest configured; few tests present)
- System health panel & charts: ❌

BACKEND (Express + Prisma)

- Project scaffolding & config: ✅
- Prisma schema & PostgreSQL connectivity: ✅
- Seed script with demo data: ✅
- Auth (login, JWT, refresh, change/reset password): ✅
- Auth middleware & RBAC (authenticateToken, requireAdmin/Manager): ✅
- Users API (list, get, create, update, delete, stats, export): ✅
- Locks API (list, get, ping, update, active/online flags): ✅
- Access endpoint for devices (POST /api/lock/access-attempt): ✅
- Access Logs API + CSV export + stats: ✅
- Dashboard API (overview + per-location): ✅
- Permissions API (list/assign/update/revoke): ✅
- RFID API (list/create/update/assign/revoke): ✅
- Location endpoints (users/locks/keys + bulk ops): ✅
- Audit logs & API: ✅
- Rate limiting (apiLimiter, authLimiter, bulkLimiter): ✅
- Error handling middleware: ✅
- City directory (`GET /api/city`): ✅
- WebSockets (server init, city-scoped events): ✅
- Background jobs (key expiry, refresh cleanup): ✅
- Notification service (email/SMS/Twilio): ❌ (deps present but not wired)
- Tenant model (Project + City in DB and APIs): ❌ (ARCHITECTURE.md describes; code is city-only)
- Caching for dashboard: ❌
- RBAC hardening everywhere: ⚠️ (core routes protected; verify all new/bulk routes validations)

DEVIATIONS & NOTES

- Route naming: Frontend uses /location/:addressId while docs mention /locations/:addressId. Functionally OK, but document or align.
- Tenant migration: Architecture and Checklist propose Project+City; current implementation is City-only with CityContext. Migration plan is documented but not executed.
- Notification service: Twilio dependency is present but not connected; architecture mentions email/SMS/PUSH options.
- Health/analytics dashboards and charts are not implemented on the frontend; backend has sufficient data endpoints.
- Testing: Backend has substantial Jest tests; frontend tests are minimal.

MATRIX AGAINST PROJECT_CHECKLIST.md

Backend (API)
- Auth, RBAC, Users, Access Logs, Dashboard, Audit, City directory: ✅
- Location Overview endpoints and bulk ops: ✅
- Key auto-expiry + WS notifications: ✅
- Rate limiting: ✅
- Notification service: ❌
- RBAC hardening and input validation coverage: ⚠️ (most done; confirm new bulk validators are complete)

Frontend
- Vite+TS+Tailwind scaffolding: ✅
- Env config and Axios client with tokens: ✅
- AuthContext and Protected routes: ✅
- Dashboard KPIs, sorting, links: ✅
- Users management UI with CSV export: ✅
- Access Logs with export: ✅
- Permissions and RFID management UIs: ✅
- Real-time KPI updates via WS: ✅
- Location Details page (Location Overview & Admin Connect): ⚠️ (exists, route naming and Nav linkage pending)
- Post-login redirect to assigned locations: ❌
- Tests for new Location Details and broader components: ❌/⚠️

MATRIX AGAINST ARCHITECTURE.md (Selected items)
- Websockets: ✅ (initWebSocket, client hook, city-scoped)
- Background jobs: ✅ (key expiry, refresh cleanup)
- Data model: ✅ for city-based; ❌ for tenant model (Project/ProjectCity)
- APIs: ✅ core endpoints; ❌ project endpoints (GET /api/project)
- Frontend structure: ⚠️ simplified vs proposed (no full layout system)
- Real-time location page behaviors: ⚠️ partially wired, events handled globally, not address-specific listeners

Summary
- The system is largely implemented for city-scoped multi-city operation with real-time updates and robust CRUD and logging.
- The biggest gap versus the architecture is the tenant migration (Project + City) and some frontend UX polish (Location Details linking, post-login redirect, health/charts, tests).
